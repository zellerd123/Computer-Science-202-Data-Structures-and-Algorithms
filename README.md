Here is the code from my 202 Computer Science Course taken in the Fall of 2023

**Data Structures and Algorithms Labs - Course 204**
Welcome to my repository for the Data Structures and Algorithms labs from my 204 course. This collection of projects and exercises showcases my understanding and application of various data structures and algorithms throughout the course.

**Course Overview**
The 204: Data Structures and Algorithms course covers fundamental concepts for efficient problem-solving and software development. Key topics include:

Basic data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
Advanced data structures: Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
Algorithmic concepts: Sorting, Searching, Recursion
Algorithmic strategies: Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming
**Labs Overview**
Each lab in this repository represents a hands-on application of the concepts covered in the course. Below is a brief overview of some of the labs included:

**Lab 1:** Ambiguous End Search:

This lab demonstrates the ability to work with search algorithms, particularly in situations with constraints like unknown list size. 

**Lab 2:** Student Ranking Algorithm:

Sorting and ranking algorithms are fundamental in many computer science applications. 

**Lab 3:** Jaccard Similarity Coefficient:

Created the Similarity formula from scratch. 

**Lab 4:** Divide and Conquer Algorithm:

Find a rank K in optimal time in two descending-ordered lists. 

**Lab 5:** Spelling Suggestions using Trie and Levenshtein Distance:

List all the words in the vocabulary with a distance less than or equal to the maximum specified distance.

**Lab 6:** Dynamic Programming for Optimal Slack:

This lab aims to design a Dynamic Programming algorithm to align text as evenly to the right as possible. 

**Lab 7:** Hill Finding Algorithm:

Hill Finding Implement an efficient hill-finding algorithm for general 2D input arrays of h x w distinct numbers

**Lab 8:** Maze Graph Traversal:

Given an n x nï»¿ array of non-negative integers, return a string representing a path consisting of the smallest number of valid
moves through the maze from the upper-left corner to the bottom-right corner or the empty string if there is no such path 

**Lab 9:** Graph-Based Logical Consistency Analysis:

use graphs to determine whether a given series of statements about time intervals are logically consistent with each other. Each statement tells you something about the relationship between arbitrary intervals but does not contain any information about the start and end times of intervals.
